# Newberry Library's Midwest Time Machine

_I found it was faster to completely rebuild this than address the dependency heck of the old one. GA4 has been added, and a few other very minor tweaks have been made from the original. The primary change is that this README is about 5 times longer._

This project is a series of StoryMaps (see [KnightLab's StoryMaps](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) for details) developed by Jen Wolfe using the diaries, letters, and memoirs of the historical figures whose lives they present. These elements were transcribed by (crowdsourced) volunteers via the [Newberry Transcribe](https://digital.newberry.org/transcribe) project. The Time Machine also represents a template for additional projects. The Nova Reperta project was built on the same core.
